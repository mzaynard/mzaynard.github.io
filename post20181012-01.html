   <h1>Blog entry 01 for October 12, 2018: Day 2</h1>
   <p>Okay, with much wailing and gnashing of teeth, the backgrounds page loads. I had to comment out the routing;doesn't make much sense now, but I'll glue it back in eventually. Here's what it looks like: <img src="images/20181011 End of day.png"></p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Declaring the CharDataComponent class</li>
    <li>Populating the dropdown menus</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>When instantiating classes, each property needs a value. It looks like I was able to add them in the constructor, but I feel like that is bad code.</li>
    <li>Arrays can be populated when they are declared, but they have to be declared in the export component of where they are used. This seems like it is not the whole story, but I haven't had a chance to delve into that more.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Today's Task List</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Get the forms to populate the CharDataComponent object properties</li>
     <li>Move standard arrays into their own class</li>
     <li>Build the logic for choosing primary, secondary, and tertiary attributes</li>
   </ul>
