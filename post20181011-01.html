    <h1>Blog entry 01 for October 11, 2018: First Steps</h1>
    <p>Started out  well; easily created a Git repository at <a href="https://github.com/mzaynard/project-1">https://github.com/mzaynard/project-1</a>. The  next step was sort of  a  snag; while creagting a new Angular  project using ng new, it froze up. I closed down the  cmd terminal, deleted the directory, and tried  it again;  we'll see how it goes.</p>
    <p>We're at the same place it hung  up earlier, extract:clean-css: sill extract clean-css@^4.1.11 ... and we're past it!</p>
    <p>Into  the post install stuff now... and successfully installed!</p>
    <h2>Design considerations</h2>
    <p>Okay, so this is going to have a splash page (with the idea of  eventually expanding it to more systems), a working page that routes particular steps of  the process, and a display page that shows progress and generates  a PDF character sheet.  I wonder how I'm going to pull  that off :)</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Open the  project with ng serve --open, and it  looks good so far, displaying the generic start screen.</p>  </div>
